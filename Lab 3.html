              <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>"Hello! My name is <b>Ibrahim Haider</b>. I’m a web enthusiast learning HTML and semantic markup."

I am an aspiring web developer who is passionate about understanding how the web truly works — not just how websites look, but how they are structured, built, and connected.<br> My journey in web development began with curiosity about how simple lines of code can create dynamic, interactive, and beautiful online experiences.

Right now, I’m focusing on mastering HTML, the fundamental language of the web. Through it, I’m learning how to organize and structure web pages logically, making every element — from headings and paragraphs to images and links — meaningful and easy to interpret by both users and browsers.

In addition, I’m exploring semantic markup, which goes beyond basic HTML coding. <br>Semantic HTML is about writing code that communicates the purpose of each part of a webpage. It makes the web more accessible to everyone, helps search engines understand page content better, and keeps the structure clean and professional.

For me, learning HTML and semantic markup is not just about building websites — it’s about learning to communicate with the web effectively. It’s a step toward creating web pages that are not only visually appealing but also technically strong, accessible, and user-friendly.

My goal is to grow into a well-rounded web developer who can blend creativity with logical structure, making the internet a more beautiful, organized, and inclusive place for all users.</p>
